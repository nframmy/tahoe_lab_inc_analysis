# tahoe_lab_inc_analysis
Analysis of laboratory incubations of periphyton collected from Lake Tahoe as part of a project funded by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Board.

This also contains analysis of tahoe nearshore network data provided by Sergio Valbuena.

Important Incubation Details:

  210301 Tahoe City incubation:
    -used average surface areas for all rocks since rocks were separated from their associated chamber numbers before these measurements were taken thus surface area measurements may not be as accurate as other incubations
    -filtered periphyton samples using GF/F's instead of nitex mesh, thus biomass measurements may be slightly different than other incubations
    
  210315 Tahoe City incubation:
    -over-enriched the chambers to around 570ug/L NO3-N and NH4-N and SRP to around 823ug/L (150% of target NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations and 259% of target SRP conc.). Thus, enriched incubations may over-estimate nutrient effect compared to other incubations. Target NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations were 400ug/L and target SRP conc. was 318ug/L.
  
  210421 Pineland Incubation:
    -under-enriched nutrients to 45ug/L NH4-N and NO3-N (~11% of target concentrations) and 67ug/L SRP (~21% of target concentrations) so nutrent effect might be underestimated in these incubations.
    -There was significant differences in periphyton biomass between the ambient and enriched incubations in april due to sloughing, the average AFDW/m2 decreased by 27% between the ambient and enriched incubations which could potentially confound results. This possibly led to lower surface area-normalized metabolic rates between the ambient and enriched incubations.
    
  210613 Pineland Incubations:
    -Performed ambient and enriched incubations on the same set of rocks and paired biomass msmsnts for these incubations.
    -Enriched chambers to the correct nutrient conctrations of 400ug/L NO3-N and NH4-N and 318ug/L SRP.
    -Data was lost from first ambient incubation, thus it was performed again later that evening.
    -Data from one presens 4-channel device quit recording during the dark portion of the enriched incubation, but the issue was fixed and data was recorded in a different file and added to the main data file later.
